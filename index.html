    <h1>Wayne's writings</h1>
    <p>
        This will eventually be a blog, but for the moment I just want to have some place to write some things down.
    </p>

    <h2>On complexity</h2>
    <p>
        I believe that the main challenge of a professional software developer is the management of complexity. It's easy
        and fun to write new software and play with newfound powers. Eventually, it's likely that the unmanaged use of these
        powers will layer up on each other and end up burying you in what is commonly known as technical debt. I have seen
        many developers go through this stage. The worst thing to do is to put one of these systems out in the wild where
        people will start using it, because that guarantees that it can't change dramatically, and will likely never will be
        restored to a state where making changes is easy and exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is much harder, and takes a lot more discipline, to manage software complexity.

    <h3>On Linguistics</h3>
    <p>
        By no means am I an expert on any of these subjects, but I think I've learned enough to be dangerous!
    </p>
    <p>
        We've reached a point in computing where we think that 3D modelling, ray-traced textures and LIDAR mapping are the peak
        of computer intelligence. But I do not believe intelligence lies in being able to perceive objects in three dimensions, or
        to be able to avoid walking into a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        I believe language is the key to intelligence. It's the strange phenominon where, by vibrating my vocal folds in just the
        right pattern, I can cause a listener to daydream about a fantasy world, or to sweat with fear, or to laugh uncontrollably.
        And it's not just by sound that this works - sign language and the written word have exactly the same effect. It's a 
        one-dimensional medium, but it holds such a ridiculous amount of power. I'm a knowledge worker, I can earn a living by
        sitting in my bedroom and constructing software that does real work and creates real productivity out there. It's amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
        In linguistic circles[1], there's a particular project to understand how the magic of language works. It's called the minimalist
        project, and its idea is to create the breakthroughs in linguistics that occurred in physics long ago, with the advent of
        <code>F = ma</code>, and the rest of Newtonian physics.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea is that there were some simple constructs that early humans made to language, and that's how language came about.
        Remember that humans aren't the only creatures that have language. I can distinguish when my cat wants to say "hello", "feed me",
        "I'm bored" or a range of other things. But I would not say that my cat understands language. They're just "words", which don't
        belong in sentences. Maybe more akin to exclamations like "Hi!", "Ouch!", or "Hey!"
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the central idea of the minimalist project is an operation called "merge". This is the process where we take two words
        and put them together in some kind of well-understood way, to create a new meaning that takes elements from both words. Research
        is ongoing, but the hope is that once humans understood merge, that was the catalyst for language and effectively human civilisation.
    </p>
    <h3>Category Theory</h3>
    <p>
        We know how to do simple things. We can write a program to add two numbers, to increase a value to include sales taxes, or
        to print out a receipt or a document. But often we're not good at making sure all these things work properly together.
    </p>
    <p>
        Category theory is a much wider topic than just trying to organise software, but one of its applications is to help developers
        understand how to make simple programs. This may seem counterintuitive, why would simplicity need training? But it is true. 
        Simplicity is not easy[2]. It's not easy to do something that is predictable and can be used flexibly, and will not break if
        you put in long texts, or negative numbers, or if you combine B before A instead of A before B.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are given laws of associativity and identity - things we don't even think about normally but assume are there. By bringing
        these ideas to the forefront, we can write programs that are more flexible and are more amenable to change.

            [1] Noam Chomsky was one of the instigators of this project.

            [2] Rich Hickey gave an influential talk on this topic.
