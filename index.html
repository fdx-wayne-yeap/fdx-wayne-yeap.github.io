    <h1>Wayne's writings</h1>
    <p>
        This will eventually be a blog, but for the moment I just want to have some place to write some things down.

    <h1>On complexity</h1>
    <p>
        I believe that the main challenge of a professional software developer is the management of complexity. It's easy
        and fun to write new software and play with newfound powers. Eventually, it's likely that the unmanaged use of these
        powers will layer up on each other and end up burying you in what is commonly known as technical debt. I have seen
        many developers go through this stage. The worst thing to do is to put one of these systems out in the wild where
        people will start using it, because that guarantees that it can't change dramatically, and will likely never will be
        restored to a state where making changes is easy and exciting.

        It is much harder, and takes a lot more discipline, to manage software complexity.
